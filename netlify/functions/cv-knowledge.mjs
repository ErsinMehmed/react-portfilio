[Source: This Portfolio Site]
This portfolio website is itself a work sample built by Ersin. Stack: React 18 + TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Vite, React Router, Framer Motion. It is fully bilingual (English/Bulgarian) with a custom i18n layer, has light and dark themes with no flash of the wrong theme, a command palette (Ctrl/Cmd+K) for keyboard navigation, subtle 3D tilt interactions on cards, route-aware skeleton loading screens, self-hosted fonts for performance, and this very "Ask about me" assistant (a Netlify serverless function calling an LLM, grounded in his CV, with the API key kept server-side). It is covered by unit/component tests (Vitest + React Testing Library) and a CI pipeline (GitHub Actions running typecheck, lint, tests, build and a Lighthouse budget). In short: the site demonstrates the senior front-end, TypeScript, accessibility, performance and AI-integration skills it describes.
